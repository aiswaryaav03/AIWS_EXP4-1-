The Cake Shop Order Calculator is a simple client-side web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application allows users to enter cake quantities and dynamically calculates the total price without reloading the page.
This experiment demonstrates the use of:
DOM element access methods
JavaScript event handling
Dynamic content updates
Basic UI styling with CSS


Objectives

Build an interactive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Access and manipulate DOM elements
Handle user actions using JavaScript events
Perform calculations on the client side
Update UI dynamically without page refresh

Features
✔ Display cake items with images and prices
✔ Input fields for cake quantities
✔ Live price calculation
✔ No page reload (fully client-side)
✔ Clean and responsive layout

 Technologies Used
HTML → Page structure
CSS → Styling and layout
JavaScript → Logic, DOM manipulation, events

 DOM Methods Used

The application uses standard DOM access techniques:
document.getElementById()
document.querySelector() (optional if extended)
These methods allow JavaScript to read input values and update the result dynamically.

 Events Implemented
 
The project responds to user interactions using:
onclick → Button click calculation
onkeyup → Live calculation while typing
onchange → Detect input value changes

Working Principle

User enters cake quantities
JavaScript reads values from input fields
Quantities are multiplied by fixed prices
Total price is calculated
Result is updated using DOM manipulation
All updates happen without page reload.
